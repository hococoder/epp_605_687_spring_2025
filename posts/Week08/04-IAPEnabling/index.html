This means that the free account Apple provides with your Apple ID will not be sufficient. This unfortunately means that you can’t code along with this example (well, you can but you won’t be able to get access to the IAP I’ll setup in the next video). As you can see, I have my paid account selected. One of the reasons why you need a paid account is that you need access to App Store Connect, which we’ll talk about near the end of the semester.</p><p class="new"> We'll be using StoreKit Configuration files here, so you should be good to go, even with your University account!</p><p>Here’s a sneak peek - App Store Connect gives you the ability to set metadata about your app, and enable certain features for your app on the store, one of which is In App Purchases. To do all this though, you have to have a paid developer account AND have your Paid Applications contract setup with Apple. This may sound daunting, but really, it’s just setting up some contact info, your bank info (so Apple can deposit that 70% of the take of your sales into you account) and some tax related info. I entered my information and had the contract in place within 24 hours.</p><img src="../../../week09/IAPAgreements.png#centerResizedSlide#centerResizedSlide" alt="IAP Agreements"/><p>Once you make sure that all that is in place, you can go over to the Capabilities tab and enabled In App Purchases. This links the StoreKit Framework into you app, and adds the In App Purchase capability to your App ID. You actually don’t need to have the paid contract in place on App Store Connect to toggle this switch, but it’s good to have that all in place before you dive into coding up your In App Purchases - even if you have everything setup properly the store will NOT return products for sale until that contract is in place .</p><img src="../../../week09/IAPAgreements.png#centerResizedSlide#centerResizedSlide" alt="IAP Capabilities"/><p style="float: left">Previous:  <A HREF="../03-IntroductionToInAppPurchases/index.html">Introduction to In App Purchases</A></p><p style="float: right">Next:  <A HREF="../05-IAPCreating/index.html" class="nextModule">Creating In App Purchases</A></p></div><footer><p>Generated with ❤️ using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p>© 2022-2023 Josh Steele (rsteele3@jhu.edu) <a href="mailto:"(rsteele3@jhu.edu)""></a></p><p>Last updated August 28, 2022, 2:14 PM</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hococoder" target="_blank">My Twitter</a> | <a href="https://github.com/hococoder" target="_blank">My GitHub</a> | <a href="https://ep.jhu.edu" target="_blank">Whiting School EPP</a> | <a href="https://blackboard.jhu.edu" target="_blank">JHU Blackboard</a></p></footer></body></html>

Apple's WWDC, or WorldWide Developer's Conference, is Apple's annual event where developers are the focus. In 2021, WWDC took place in an all virtual format, similar to WWDC 2020 and WWDC 21, all thanks to COVID-19. All the platforms - iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS - all get some sort of attention each year, where Apple employees guide you through the latest changes to the operating systems, so you can implement those new features in your app. There is WAY too much to cover here, so we'll cover a few things that I thought were high priority enough to get your attention, and leave the rest to learn about on your own. The <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-developer/id640199958">Apple Developer App</a> for macOS and iOS is a great way to watch the videos from many years of WWDC. I highly suggest it! For now, let's discuss the following:</p><ul><li>the <code>searchable()</code> modifier</li><li>Foundation improvements</li><li>and using DocC documentation in Xcode.</li></ul><h2>The <code>searchable()</code> modifier</h2><p>Inserting a search field, which seems like a no-brainer for certain apps, has always been less than easy to implement. That all changes in iOS 15 with the <code>searchable()</code> modifier:</p><pre><code><span class="type">ContentView</span>()
  .<span class="call">searchable</span>(text: <span class="property">$text</span>)
</code></pre><p>It is available on all platforms, and can adapt accordingly based on what it is attached to. For example, when used with a <code>NavigationView</code> it knows to place that search field on top of the entries being displayed.</p><pre><code><span class="type">NavigationView</span> {
  <span class="type">MyEntries</span>(text: <span class="property">$text</span>) {
    <span class="type">ForEach</span>(data) { item <span class="keyword">in</span> 
      <span class="type">Text</span>(<span class="string">"The item is</span> \(item)<span class="string">"</span>)
    }
  }
}
.<span class="call">searchable</span>(text: <span class="property">$text</span>)
</code></pre><p>To tell if the user is actively searching, you can use the value of the <code>\.isSearching</code> keypath in the <code>@Environment</code>:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">@Environment</span>(\.<span class="property">isSearching</span>) <span class="keyword">private var</span> isSearching: <span class="type">Bool</span>
</code></pre><p>This can let you update your display accordingly to display search results. Apple suggests using the <code>.overlay</code> modifier to put your results on top of the main list, so that main list remains unchanged.</p><p>More can be found <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/10176">in this WWDC video</a>!</p><h2>Improvements to the Foundation Framework</h2><p>The Foundation framework provides, well, a strong foundation for the rest of the Apple branded OSes out there. It contains classes for working with Dates, Strings, Collections, and more. Some notable improvements to Foundation this year were:</p><h3>Support for <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a></h3><p>Mardkown was developed by John Gruber (of Daring Fireball) and Aaron Swartz in 2004. It has become a standard for its ability to convert "plain text" files with some markup into HTML. In Foundation, you can now apply style to your localized strings. For example:</p><p>In addition the API for <code>AttributedString</code> has been greatly improved, and both it and <code>NSAttributedString</code> from Objective C are now Localizable, like other strings in your app.</p><ul><li>Foundation's formatters have been greatly improved! Instead of:</li></ul><pre><code><span class="keyword">let</span> dateFormatter = <span class="type">DateFormatter</span>()

<span class="keyword">init</span>() {
  dateFormatter.<span class="property">dateStyle</span> = .<span class="dotAccess">medium</span>
  dateFormatter.<span class="property">timeStyle</span> = .<span class="dotAccess">medium</span>
}

<span class="keyword">func</span> generateMyData() {
  <span class="keyword">let</span> formattedDate = dateFormatter.<span class="call">string</span>(from: myDate)
  <span class="keyword">let</span> formattedNumber = <span class="type">String</span>(format: <span class="string">"%.2f"</span>, myNumber)
}

</code></pre><p>you can now do:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">init</span>() {
  <span class="comment">//nothing here!</span>
}

<span class="keyword">func</span> generateMyData() {
  <span class="keyword">let</span> formattedDate = myDate.<span class="call">formatted</span>(date: .<span class="dotAccess">abbreviated</span>, time: .<span class="dotAccess">standard</span>)
  <span class="keyword">let</span> formattedNumber = myNumber.<span class="call">formatted</span>(.<span class="dotAccess">number</span>.<span class="call">precision</span>(.<span class="call">fractionalLength</span>(<span class="number">2</span>)))
}
</code></pre><p>This is a much more verbose way to do this formatting, it saves on some code (no more separate formatter initialization), and you lower your chances of getting the formatting string wrong when working with numbers.<br><br><br>More can be found <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/10109/">in this WWDC video</a></p><h2>Using DocC to document your code</h2><p>DocC is a new, and open sourced, framework for not only documenting your code, but generating tutorials and reference documentation as well. The syntax is very straightforward, and supports Markdown:</p><pre><code><span class="comment">/// The myFunc method
/// 
/// You can even include Markdown code blocks here
///
/// - Parameters: 
///   - foo: The Foo parameter
///   - bar: The Bar parameter</span>
<span class="keyword">func</span> myFunc(parameter1: <span class="type">Foo</span>, parameter2: bar) {

}
</code></pre><p>The documentation can be built inside the Project -&gt; Build Documentation menu, which also builds any tutorials or reference documents you have made outside your project.</p><p>The documentation is also immediately available to within Xcode - or a developer using your framework - by holding down alt and clicking on items such as parameters, classes and structs.</p><p>You can also export the documentation and deploy it to its own server, the engine for which Apple provides as part of DocC. Many of the modern day tutorials at Apple on SwiftUI are built and deployed using DocC!</p><p>More can be found <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc2021/10166/">in this WWDC video</a>!</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>That's it! You've survived the course (well, except for your final projects). I hope you've gotten some iOS basics down and feel confident about going into deeper water, maybe even making your own app one day. If you do, please drop me a note - I'd love to take a look and help test if needed.</p><p style="float: left">Previous:  <A HREF="../03-TestFlight/index.html">Introduction to TestFlight</A></p></div><footer><p>Generated with ❤️ using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p>© 2023-2024 Josh Steele (rsteele3@jhu.edu) <a href="mailto:"(rsteele3@jhu.edu)""></a></p><p>Last updated October 1, 2023 at 12:38 PM</p><p><a href="https://mastodon.social/@hococoder" target="_blank">My Mastodon</a> | <a href="https://github.com/hococoder" target="_blank">My GitHub</a> | <a href="https://ep.jhu.edu" target="_blank">Whiting School EPP</a> | <a href="https://canvas.jhu.edu" target="_blank">JHU Canvas</a></p></footer></body></html>

<h2>Overview</h2><p>The developer portal at <a href="https://developer.apple.com">https://developer.apple.com</a> is the place to go for everything developer related at Apple.</p><ul><li>You can get information on the various platforms, including macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS.</li><li>You can get information on resources about the platforms, the various tools and languages, UI, iOS design tips, and more</li><li>If you want to become a developer, you can research the different developer programs, and you can get access to support features such as FAQs, forums, and contact information for Apple’s developers support program.</li><li>Finally - the most important section for active developers is the Account section, where you can register an appID for your app, generate developer certificates, provisioning profiles, and more.</li></ul><p>Here's the landing page for the developer portal:</p><img src="../../../week13/DevPortal.png#centerResizedSlide" alt="Developer Portal"/><p>Let’s talk about a few of those things you can do in the Account section of the Developer Portal.</p><h3>Developer and Distribution Certificates</h3><p>An important part of developing for iOS is establishing a chain of trust. Only apps that are properly signed and distributed by Apple can be installed on iPhones (at least ones that aren’t jailbroken).</p><ul><li>The first part of establishing that trust chain is to tell Apple that you are who you are. Keychain access on macOS is used to create a certificate signing request that can be sent to Apple in order to request a certificate. Since Apple trusts Keychain Access, and it knows you have a paid developer account, it returns a certificate to you that it trusts.<ul><li>Developer Certificate - this gives you the ability to push an app to a local device for testing ONLY. The certificate is used as part of the signing process for your app</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Distribution Certificate - while there can be as many developer certificates as there are developers on your team, there is typically only 1 distribution certificate (Enterprise accounts can have 2, potentially more). Only one designated team role (Team Agent) can submit apps to the store, so the distribution certificate will appear on one machine (or be bound with one account) only.</li></ul><ul><li>A paid account can have any number of developer certificates associated with it, which gives you the ability to submit an app to a local device for testing only. Only 1 distribution certificate is available, but enterprise accounts can have 2. This is because that for normal developer accounts, only 1 role - the Team Agent - can submit apps to the app store, so only that developer needs to have the distribution certificate.</li></ul><p>Here is what the Certificates area looks like in the Developer Portal</p><img src="../../../week13/Certificates.png#centerResizedSlide" alt="Certificates"/><p>With recent Xcode versions, certificate generation is performed by Xcode and the certificate is uploaded automatically to the Developer Portal. You can still create them by hand, though.</p><h3>App IDs</h3><p>When you are setting your app up, there are a series of IDs that you establish for it, the App ID being the most important. This is a unique ID for each app, which consists of the App ID Prefix, which is typically a pregenerated team ID, and a bundle ID string, that typically uses a reverse domain type as a prefix in front of the app name, for example, <code>edu.jhu.MyAppName</code>. There are other types of IDs that let you generate passes for Apple Wallet, iCloud containers, app groups, and more.</p><img src="../../../week13/AppIDs.png#centerResizedSlide" alt="AppIDs"/><ul><li>App IDs - these are unique IDs for each App you want to put on the App Store. They consist of these 2 components, which have a “.” between them in the final ID<ul><li>App ID prefix - this is typically your pregenerated Team ID</li><li>App ID suffix - a bundle ID search string that may be explicit or a wildcard:<ul><li>Explicit - typically presented in reverse domain style (edu.jhu.epp.MyApp). Required if using services such as Game Center, IAP, etc, or want a unique ID for your App</li><li>Wildcard - one ID can cover more than one actual App. You should still use reverse domain name, but leave the last element as a “<em>” - for example, edu.jhu.epp.</em></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Pass Type IDs - used to make Pass Certificates, which are used to send updates to your Passbook (now Apple Wallet) passes</li><li>Website Push IDs - allows your website to send push notifications through APNS</li><li>iCloud Containers - Lets you use iCloud Storage APIs to store data in iCloud</li><li>App Groups - Allows apps within the group to share a common data container and other inter-process communication (IPC)</li><li>Merchant IDs - Allows you to generate Apple Pay certificates</li></ul><p>Here is the list of available App IDs as of this semester:</p><img src="../../../week13/AppIDTypes.png#centerResized" alt="AppID Types"/><h3>Device Registration</h3><img src="../../../week13/Devices.png#centerResizedSlide" alt="Devices"/><ul><li>Each Developer Account comes with a fixed number of devices that can be used for testing (the list of devices can be modified/reset once per year)</li><li>To test during development, you need to register your device with the portal so that the system can report itself as a valid test device for this app. This can be done by registering the the device's UDID (Unique Device ID)<ul><li>Manually - team agents and admins can add UDIDs to the portal, either one at a time, or from a list</li><li>Automatically via Xcode - once you specify which team you are on, and connect your device and try to run an app on it, Xcode will register the device if it isn't already.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Provisioning Profiles</h3><p>The thing that ties it all together is the provisioning profile. Provisioning profiles are for a particular app ID, a particular set of users (represented by their certificates), and a set of devices (represented by their registered UDIDs).</p><ul><li>Provisioning Profiles are the main component that allows for the addition of an App to a given device. Setting up a Provisioning Profile requires the following:<ul><li>The type of profile (Development or Distribution, and which subtype)</li><li>A set of devices (represented by their registered UDIDs) (important for development profiles)</li><li>The app for which this profile is valid</li><li>A list of the users that may use that profile (and each user must have a valid Certificate installed in the portal)</li></ul></li></ul><p>Modern versions of Xcode will handle the creation of wildcard versions of provisioning profiles that you can use. However, if you want to create profiles that have specific capabilities such as notifications or app groups, you have to make a profile of your own. Remember, as with certificates, distribution provisioning profiles are limited - only the team agent or admin can make them, while development profiles can be made by any developer certificate.</p><p>Some things to note:</p><ul><li>When you’re first starting out, you don’t have to do anything special with the portal - Xcode actually manages a Developer Provisioning Profile that is assigned to a Wildcard App ID (handling all apps in the system).</li><li>Distribution Profiles are similar to Distribution Certificates - they are very limited in number and are only available to the users that have the Distribution Certificates</li></ul><p>Here's the profiles page on the developer portal when you go to make a new profile:</p><img src="../../../week13/Profiles.png#centerResizedSlide" alt="Profiles"/><p>Although Xcode handles much of the development portal work for you in the latest versions of Xcode, you can always fall back to the development portal to get things done if needed - and better yet, Xcode syncs up with the contents at the portal, so it will attempt to stay up to date.<br><br></p><p style="float: left">Previous:  <A HREF="../../Week13/01-IntroductionToUserFeedback/index.html">Introduction to User Feedback</A></p><p style="float: right">Next:  <A HREF="../../Week13/03-IntroductionToAppStoreConnect/index.html">Introduction to App Store Connect</A></p><BR/><BR/></div><leftsideempty></leftsideempty><footer><p>Generated with ❤️ using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p>© 2023-2024 Josh Steele (rsteele3@jhu.edu) <a href="mailto:"(rsteele3@jhu.edu)""></a></p><p>Last updated January 25, 2025 at 6:17 PM</p><p><a href="https://mastodon.social/@hococoder" target="_blank">My Mastodon</a> | <a href="https://github.com/hococoder" target="_blank">My GitHub</a> | <a href="https://ep.jhu.edu" target="_blank">Whiting School EPP</a> | <a href="https://canvas.jhu.edu" target="_blank">JHU Canvas</a></p></footer></div></body></html>

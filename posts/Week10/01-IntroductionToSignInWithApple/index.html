The content below and in the videos will work if you have a paid developer account, and is here simply for reference and learning.</p><p>Sign in with Apple was introduced at WWDC 2019, and is Apple's way to build in a login system into your app that protects your privacy. Instead of using a social media account, or coming up with yet another username and password combination to remember next time you log in, Sign in with Apple uses your existing Apple ID to establish credentials for an app or website.</p><p>Better yet, it allows you to keep control of your personal information - apps and websites can only ask for, at most, your name and email address, when registering.</p><p>You can even use Apple's Hide My Email service to generate a unique, random email address that forwards to your personal email. This allows you to stay in touch with the app developer without giving up your personal email address.</p><p>Sign in with Apple also doesn't track you as you use other apps or visit other websites, and only retains the information you need to manage your account - nothing more.</p><p>But if you're a developer, how do you implement Sign in with Apple in your app?</p><h2>Setting up</h2><p>First, you need to make sure that you have a paid developer account, because you'll need to enable a capability in your app.</p><p>In the starter project, go to the project settings file, and go to the Signing and Capabilities tab in Xcode. Here, you'll need to setup your bundle identifier and team identifier, since we're dealing with entitlements and capabilities. Ours is already set from previous examples.</p><p>While we're in this tab, also go ahead and add the Sign in with Apple capability. Click the plus button and type in "Sign in" in the search box to let you choose the Sign in with Apple capability.</p><p>Although we won't explore it in this course, you can also add a capability here for using Associated Domains, which allows you to take advantage of the .well-known file on your server if you are also going to be managing passwords with your website.</p><p>With that in place, let's add some UI, which we'll do in the next module.</p><p style="float: left">Previous:  <A HREF="../00-Week10Overview/index.html">Week 10 Overview</A></p><p style="float: right">Next:  <A HREF="../02-SIWAButton/index.html" class="nextModule">Sign in With Apple Button</A></p></div><footer><p>Generated with ❤️ using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p>© 2022-2023 Josh Steele (rsteele3@jhu.edu) <a href="mailto:"(rsteele3@jhu.edu)""></a></p><p>Last updated September 11, 2022, 6:00 PM</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hococoder" target="_blank">My Twitter</a> | <a href="https://github.com/hococoder" target="_blank">My GitHub</a> | <a href="https://ep.jhu.edu" target="_blank">Whiting School EPP</a> | <a href="https://blackboard.jhu.edu" target="_blank">JHU Blackboard</a></p></footer></body></html>

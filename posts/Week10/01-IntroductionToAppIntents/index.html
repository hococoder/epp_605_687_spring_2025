<h2>Overview</h2><p>Functions are not just repeatable sets of behaviors in your app. They also define your app relative to all the other apps on the App Store. From manipulating photos to sending your favorite order to your local coffee shop to converting one file format to another, your app’s main functions and how you use them are what makes your app unique.</p><p>App Intents was introduced in iOS 16 and helps developers expose their app’s entities and functionality, or intents, to other apps on the device. In previous years, App Intents was designed to interface with Shortcuts, Widgets, Search, and more.</p><p>With iOS 18, Siri becomes the latest framework to gain access to App Intents. In addition, the newly announced Apple Intelligence framework also gets a hook into the App Intents system, bringing not only the power of your voice but also of Apple Intelligence under the App Intents ecosystem.</p><a name="theAppIntentsLayer"></a>
<h2>The App Intents Layer</h2><p>Apps in iOS, and other Apple operating systems, are sandboxed from one another. This means that each app is isolated from others on the system. This is very important from a security perspective. For example, other apps on the system can’t see into your app’s documents folder and vice versa.</p><p>This same security feature, however, also applies to any functionality you have in your app. Without help from the operating system, you can’t share functionality with other apps or system frameworks. Some features, such as share sheets, allow for the transfer of information between apps, but functionality remains behind the sandbox wall.</p><p>The App Intents framework introduces a layer between your app and system frameworks, as shown in Figure 1 below.</p><img src="../../../week11/figure-1.png#center" alt="Figure 1"/><p>The bottom row in the figure represents your app. As mentioned, it’s sandboxed by itself, keeping its data and functionality isolated from other parts of the system.</p><p>However, this app uses App Intents, which is shown in the middle row. The App Intents framework, which contains interfaces, structures, classes, and macros, lets you decorate or define your existing data objects, exposing entities or functionality defined by those data objects to the broader system.</p><p>App Intents provides access to the System frameworks in the top row in Figure 1. As mentioned earlier, before iOS 18, this included Shortcuts, Search, Widgets and more. Why is this layered setup so important?</p><a name="focusingOnReuse"></a>
<h2>Focusing On Reuse</h2><p>The top two rows of Figure 1 should really be modified in one more way to make it demonstrate how things work in code realistically.</p><img src="../../../week11/figure-2.png#center" alt="Figure 2"/><p>In Figure 2, the system framework layer, the top row, is now thinner than the other two layers. This demonstrates that the App Intents layer is pulling a lot of weight when it comes to implementing App Intents in your app. The framework is thicker than the other frameworks that use it, such as Shortcuts. What exactly does this mean?</p><p>When you add App Intents support to your app, you are mostly adding a set of generic definitions to your code that allows the App Intents framework to use your entities and intents. At first, there’s no direct connection to the actual frameworks for which you’ll add support in your app.</p><p>This means that the definitions you initially create can be used throughout the framework implementations in the thinner top layer. You still have to create some system framework implementations, such as a shortcut, but they can use the more generic definitions created in the App Intents layer. Once you create those definitions, you can easily add some extra code to hook into any of the system frameworks that App Intents provides access to.</p><a name="introducingSiriToAppIntents"></a>
<h2>Introducing Siri to App Intents</h2><p>With the introduction of support for Siri in iOS 18, Figure 2 now looks like the figure below.</p><img src="../../../week11/figure-3.png#center" alt="Figure 3"/><p>Before iOS 18, SiriKit was the framework that developers used to interface their apps with Siri. Now, with Siri able to take advantage of App Intents, all of the entities you defined in your app’s versions that supported iOS 16 and iOS 17 are instantly available to Siri. All you have to do is add a little support for Siri-specific objects in your code.</p><p>Next, let's' look at what is needed to add a simple App Intent (and its associated App Entity) to your app.</p><p style="float: left">Previous:  <A HREF="../../Week10/00-Week10Overview/index.html">Week 10 Overview</A></p><p style="float: right">Next:  <A HREF="../../Week10/02-TheAppEntityProtocol/index.html">The App Entity Protocol</A></p><BR/><BR/></div><leftside><u><p>Week 10</p></u><div class="weekSection"><ul><li><div class="comment-container"><div class="tocItem"><a id="Week 10 Overview" href="../../Week10/00-Week10Overview/index.html">Week 10 Overview</a></div><div class="chain chain-bottom"></div></div></li><li><div class="comment-container"><div class="chain chain-top"></div><div class="tocItem"><a id="Introduction to App Intents" href="../../Week10/01-IntroductionToAppIntents/index.html">Introduction to App Intents</a></div><div class="chain chain-bottom"></div></div></li><li><div class="comment-container"><div class="chain chain-top"></div><div class="tocItem"><a id="The App Entity Protocol" href="../../Week10/02-TheAppEntityProtocol/index.html">The App Entity Protocol</a></div><div class="chain chain-bottom"></div></div></li><li><div class="comment-container"><div class="chain chain-top"></div><div class="tocItem"><a id="The App Intent Protocol" href="../../Week10/03-TheAppIntentProtocol/index.html">The App Intent Protocol</a></div><div class="chain chain-bottom"></div></div></li><li><div class="comment-container"><div class="chain chain-top"></div><div class="tocItem"><a id="Getting Ready for App Intents" href="../../Week10/04-GettingReadyForAppIntents/index.html">Getting Ready for App Intents</a></div><div class="chain chain-bottom"></div></div></li><li><div class="comment-container"><div class="chain chain-top"></div><div class="tocItem"><a id="Using App Intents with Search" href="../../Week10/05-UsingAppIntentsWithSearch/index.html">Using App Intents with Search</a></div></div></li></ul></div></leftside><footer><p>Generated with ❤️ using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p>© 2023-2024 Josh Steele (rsteele3@jhu.edu) <a href="mailto:"(rsteele3@jhu.edu)""></a></p><p>Last updated January 23, 2025 at 6:01 PM</p><p><a href="https://mastodon.social/@hococoder" target="_blank">My Mastodon</a> | <a href="https://github.com/hococoder" target="_blank">My GitHub</a> | <a href="https://ep.jhu.edu" target="_blank">Whiting School EPP</a> | <a href="https://canvas.jhu.edu" target="_blank">JHU Canvas</a></p></footer></div></body></html>

Note: This is an older video using an earlier version of Xcode and iOS, but the concepts are the same.
</p>
</center><p>An important part of any application development process is testing your code. Luckily Xcode has some built in tools that help with that. First, let’s look at a functional test, and as I’m doing it, I’ll show you some of the testing UI in the Xcode interface.</p><p>Tests have been there all along - if you specify them when creating your project - and I’ve got a sample project here with a view controller all ready to go to walk you through some of the basics. Under the UnitTest<em>ExampleTests folder, Xcode has already added a file called UnitTests</em>ExampleTests. As you can see, the XCTestCase parent puts some template code in here for you - the setUp and tearDown methods do exactly what they say - setup and tear down the testing environment. This may involve establishing database connections, opening files, initializing view controllers and so forth. In our case, we’ll initialize the view controller. We’ve got a method in our ViewController called addTwoIntegers, so let’s make a test method for that called testAddTwoIntegers. This naming convention is important so that Xcode sees it as a viable unit test. Inside that method, I can put an XCTAssert call, to check that the result of a call to the addTwoIntegers method is what I expect. Here, I expect 40 + 2 to be 42. If not, I’ll put a string stating what is wrong.</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">func</span> testAddTwoIntegers()
{
  <span class="call">XCTAssert</span>(unitTestView.<span class="call">addTwoIntegers</span>(num1: <span class="number">40</span>, num2: <span class="number">2</span>) == <span class="number">42</span>, <span class="string">"That is not the answer!"</span>)
}
</code></pre><p>You may have noticed in the left gutter of the editor some empty diamonds - these denote recognized test methods by the system, and signify one way of running this particular test. You can also go to the Test Navigator in the left hand pane to see the list of methods you can run, and as you hover over them a play button appears next to the name of the method. Either way works, so let’s run one of those now. The code compiles, and the test is run. The green checkmark shows that it passed. Now let’s change our expected result to 43, and run the test again. This time the test fails, and a red x is shown, along with our error message. Let’s put that back to 42 so it runs fine next time.</p><p>We can also run performance tests in Xcode. These tests can be used to determine if the performance of a set of code has changed dramatically from an established baseline, which may indicate some sort of regression in your code. I’ve got a method in the view controller that finds the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1,000,000. To write a test method for this, we can use the measure method of XCTestCase to pass in the block that we want to measure. We can use the built in method from the template for this test, so let’s run the method and see what happens.</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">func</span> testPerformanceExample() <span class="keyword">throws</span> {
  <span class="comment">// This is an example of a performance test case.</span>
  <span class="keyword">self</span>.<span class="call">measure</span> {
    <span class="keyword">self</span>.<span class="property">unitTestView</span>.<span class="call">doSomeLoopedTask</span>()
  }
}
</code></pre><p>In the right hand side of the editor next to the test, we can see the time it took to run. If we double click on that, a popup shows more details on the performance. Performance tests run the code 10 times, and take the average time it takes to run the code. Let’s set this result as our baseline, and go back and try a different technique for the code, and run the test again. This time, our performance is worse by 18%.</p><p>The last sort of functional test we’ll look at it one for testing asynchronous code, called an Expectation. I’ve got some code in the testAsynchronousURLConnection already that downloads some data from a URLSession, and we’ll add some assertions and expectations to see if our code works as expected.</p><p>First we can add some assertions to make sure that certain things are true - like the data should not be nil, while the error should be nil. We can also check the response and original URLs match up, that the status code is 200, and that we’re getting back a response of text/html. These are all done with variations of the XCTestAssert method - using NotNil, Nil, or Equal as appropriate. We can also use the XCTFail method if we reach the else block.</p><p>OK, let’s get to expectations. Expectations are called that because you “expect” things to be done in a certain amount of time. We can define an expectation before we setup our url session, and give it a description - we’re getting the URL. At the end of the completion block, we call the fulfill method on the expect. This marks the expectation as having been met. After our resume call on the task, we invoke waitForExpectation, give it a timeout, and a completion handler. waitForExpectation waits to hear whether the fulfill() method gets invoked on the expectation, and if it doesn’t, the body of the completion handler is invoked.</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">func</span> testAsynchronousURLConnection()
{
  <span class="keyword">let</span> url = <span class="type">URL</span>(string: <span class="string">"https://www.jhuapl.edu/"</span>)!
  <span class="keyword">let</span> expect = <span class="call">expectation</span>(description: <span class="string">"GET</span> \(url)<span class="string">"</span>)
  
  <span class="keyword">let</span> session = <span class="type">URLSession</span>.<span class="property">shared</span>
  
  session.<span class="call">dataTask</span>(with: url, completionHandler: { data, response, error <span class="keyword">in</span>
    
    <span class="call">XCTAssertNotNil</span>(data, <span class="string">"data should not be nil"</span>)
    <span class="call">XCTAssertNil</span>(error, <span class="string">"error should be nil"</span>)
    
    <span class="keyword">if let</span> <span class="type">HTTPResponse</span> = response <span class="keyword">as</span>? <span class="type">HTTPURLResponse</span>,
      <span class="keyword">let</span> responseURL = <span class="type">HTTPResponse</span>.<span class="property">url</span>,
      <span class="keyword">let</span> <span class="type">MIMEType</span> = <span class="type">HTTPResponse</span>.<span class="call">mimeType</span>
    {
      <span class="call">XCTAssertEqual</span>(responseURL.<span class="property">absoluteString</span>, url.<span class="property">absoluteString</span>, <span class="string">"HTTP response URL should be equal to original URL"</span>)
      <span class="call">XCTAssertEqual</span>(<span class="type">HTTPResponse</span>.<span class="property">statusCode</span>, <span class="number">200</span>, <span class="string">"HTTP response status code should be 200"</span>)
      <span class="call">XCTAssertEqual</span>(<span class="type">MIMEType</span>, <span class="string">"text/html"</span>, <span class="string">"HTTP response content type should be text/html"</span>)
    }
    <span class="keyword">else</span>
    {
      <span class="keyword">return</span>
    }
    
    expect.<span class="call">fulfill</span>()
  }).<span class="call">resume</span>()
  
  
  <span class="call">waitForExpectations</span>(timeout: <span class="number">5.0</span>, handler:
    {
      error <span class="keyword">in
      if let</span> error = error
      {
        <span class="call">print</span>(<span class="string">"Error:</span> \(error.<span class="property">localizedDescription</span>)<span class="string">"</span>)
      }
  })
}
</code></pre><p>If we run this test, we can see that indeed, the test passes because we can reach the specified URL. What if I disconnect the wireless? If I try again now, my assertions get flagged right at the start - but because we end up going into the else block and returning from the completion handler before the expectation can be fulfilled, we hit our timeout and the error is thrown to the console. I can double check on things by commenting out those 2 top assertions and running again. Sure enough, the timeout is exceeded, and an error is thrown. Tests like this for networking calls can be used to see how your code deals in less than ideal network conditions, and those conditions happen way more often than you think.</p><p style="float: left">Previous:  <A HREF="../06-IntroductionToUnitTesting/index.html">Introduction To Unit Testing</A></p><p style="float: right">Next:  <A HREF="../../Week13/00-Week13Overview/index.html">Week 13 Overview</A></p></div><footer><p>Generated with ❤️ using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p>© 2023-2024 Josh Steele (rsteele3@jhu.edu) <a href="mailto:"(rsteele3@jhu.edu)""></a></p><p>Last updated September 17, 2023 at 8:44 PM</p><p><a href="https://mastodon.social/@hococoder" target="_blank">My Mastodon</a> | <a href="https://github.com/hococoder" target="_blank">My GitHub</a> | <a href="https://ep.jhu.edu" target="_blank">Whiting School EPP</a> | <a href="https://canvas.jhu.edu" target="_blank">JHU Canvas</a></p></footer></body></html>

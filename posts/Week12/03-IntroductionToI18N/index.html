It is available in over 150 countries, and Asia - especially China - and Europe are the quickest growing populations for iOS adoption. Many of these potential users are NOT English speakers so to make your app available to the widest audience possible, it’s vital to get your app ready to handle different languages and locales. This is where internationalization and localization come into play.</p><h2>What's the Difference?</h2><p>So what’s the difference between internationalization and localization?</p><ul><li>Internationalization, which is usually abbreviated "i18n", is the process of designing your app for international compatibility. This covers features such as:<ul><li>Handling text input and output in the user’s native language</li><li>Handling different time, date and number formats</li><li>Using the appropriate calendar and time zones</li><li>Using system API calls and best practices, such as auto layout and right to left text, that enable your app for any language.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Localization, which is often abbreviated "l10n", is the process of translating the app’s UI and resources into another language. This is done by:<ul><li>Using tools such as built in API calls</li><li>Using the <code>GenStrings</code> application to create string replacements for text in your code</li><li>Using 3rd party translators to put your app’s text in other languages.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>UIKit, AutoLayout and Internationalization</h2><p>We didn't really get into UIKit and AutoLayout this semester, but if you do, there are some things to keep in mind - we'll talk later about how these differ in SwiftUI, if at all. Many of these best practices are built into SwiftUI's layout system, so you don't have to worry about them.</p><p>To prepare your app to use localization resources properly, you should use Auto Layout during the internationalization process. The biggest thing to key in on here is that Auto Layout allows your app’s components to reconfigure their size and location if configured properly. Some tips are:</p><ul><li>Don’t constrain elements to have fixed widths - this will avoid cropping if text in another language is longer than the text is in English.</li><li>Make heavy use of intrinsic content sizes in your text fields and labels, which allow them to auto resize.</li><li>In order to handle left to right vs right to left presentations, using leading and trailing attributes in your constraints so that the auto layout system can lay them out appropriately.</li><li>For the internal views that are away from the boundaries, pin them to adjacent views, so as the other views get resized, the pinned views will as well.</li><li>You should also avoid setting the min or max sizes of windows - let things adjust as needed.</li><li>Be sure to test, test, and test again - and you can use the built in Pseudolanguage text replacement to do that testing - see the option in the scheme editor below:</li></ul><img src="../../../week12/PseudoLang.png#center" alt="Pseudo Language"/><h2>Right to Left Languages</h2><p>Languages such as Hebrew and Arabic are written from right to left, unlike Latin based languages which go from left to right. iOS has built in support of bidirectional views in standard views and controls. For custom controls, however, you need to handle this feature yourself. The link <a href="https://devstreaming-cdn.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2013/219xax4xjor8i6b9h77lafay32/219/ref.mov#t=53:16,54:34">here</a> is a section from a WWDC 2013 session about making your app world ready that is very interesting.</p><p>Starting with iOS 9:</p><ul><li>Standard UIKit controls automatically flip in a right to left context.</li><li>UIImage has a method called imageFlippedForRightToLeftLayoutDirection, which helps to flip an image when appropriate</li><li>UIView has some built in attributes that help specify how certain views should look when flipped.</li></ul><h2>Localization</h2><p>Now let’s turn our attention to localization. Each app by default, has a base localization, which is usually in the developer’s native language. You can then add languages in the project settings, some of which are shown below. Once you do this, an .lproj directory gets added to the directory structure which contains a strings file for each storyboard, xib, or localized file in your base language directory.</p><img src="../../../week12/Localizations.png#centerResizedSlide" alt="Pseudo Language"/><p>If you want to manage your localizations by hand there is an Xcode tool to help called GenStrings. Once you’ve replaced all of your user facing strings with <code>NSLocalizedString</code> macros (in UIKit) or <code>LocalizedStringKey</code> objects in SwiftUI, you can run the code below to generate a strings file.</p><p>For UIKit:</p><pre><code>find . -name \*.m | xargs genstrings -o .
</code></pre><p>For SwiftUI:</p><pre><code>find ./ -name <span class="string">"*.swift"</span> -print0 | xargs -<span class="number">0</span> genstrings -a -<span class="type">SwiftUI</span> -o en.<span class="property">lproj</span>
</code></pre><p>This makes a Localizable.strings file, and for each instance of <code>NSLocalizedString</code> or <code>LocalizedStringKey</code>, a comment and key-value pair like the one seen below will appear in the file. You can then add this strings file to all of your language folders, and go in and change the right hand side (the value of the key value pair) to the language appropriate string.</p><pre><code><span class="string">"key"</span> = <span class="string">"value"</span>
</code></pre><p>For larger apps, or apps where you are not an expert in the language you want to localize into, a third party service can help. Xcode helps with this by including Export for Localization and Import Localization menu items in the Editor menu (these appear when the project file is selected).</p><img src="../../../week12/ExportLocalizations.png#centerResized" alt="Export Localizations"/><p>The Export menu item generates a set of files that you can send off to your translators, at which point they will return one set of files for each language you want to translate. The import menu does the opposite, and turns the translator’s files into the appropriate directories and strings files that Xcode needs to present the app in multiple languages.</p><img src="../../../week12/LocalizationFlow.png#center" alt="Localization Flow"/><p style="float: left">Previous:  <A HREF="../02-AccessibilityExample/index.html">Accessibility Example</A></p><p style="float: right">Next:  <A HREF="../04-I18NExample/index.html" class="nextModule">I18N Example</A></p></div><footer><p>Generated with ❤️ using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p>© 2022-2023 Josh Steele (rsteele3@jhu.edu) <a href="mailto:"(rsteele3@jhu.edu)""></a></p><p>Last updated September 11, 2022, 5:57 PM</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hococoder" target="_blank">My Twitter</a> | <a href="https://github.com/hococoder" target="_blank">My GitHub</a> | <a href="https://ep.jhu.edu" target="_blank">Whiting School EPP</a> | <a href="https://blackboard.jhu.edu" target="_blank">JHU Blackboard</a></p></footer></body></html>
